                            <u>Anime: </u> Attack On Titan<br/><br/>
                            <u>Author: </u> Hajime Isayama<br/><br/>
                            <u>My Thoughts: </u> Probably my most favourite anime. The story is centered around a group of people who 
                            fight giant monsters known as Titans. And they try to uncover the secrets of the titans and try not to loose 
                            their lives in the process.I watched this about 5 years ago and I still get shocked by all the twists and 
                            turns in the story. <br/>

                            <u>Anime: </u> Jujutsu Kaisen<br/><br/>
                            <u>Author: </u> Gege Akutami<br/><br/>
                            <u>My Thoughts: </u> This anime is centered around a group of individuals who have special powers due to a 
                            phenomenon known as <i>cursed energy</i>. The best part of JJK is that all the characters are extremely cool, 
                            and all the fights are super fun to watch/read. It's pure entertainment!<br/>

                            <u>Anime: </u> Naruto<br/><br/>
                            <u>Author: </u> Masashi Kishimoto<br/><br/>
                            <u>My Thoughts: </u> Another favourite! The anime is about a little boy named Naruto who has the soul of a demon 
                            fox sealed inside of him. The people in his village avoid him due to this reason. But nevertheless, he conquers
                             his adeversities and becomes a hero to his people. Along the way he makes many friends and enemies, who fight 
                             him in grand battles over clashing ideals. Naruto's ability to sway his worst enemies forms the crux of the story.<br/>
