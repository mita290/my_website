                            <u>My Thoughts: </u> This is one of my all-time favourite books. The book is about a little boy who 
                            has some a medical condition which makes it difficult for him to befriend other kids in his class. But slowly
                            he begins to encounter people who he can rely on. The story is very inspiring and I read it whenever I'm 
                            feeling down and need motivation.<br/>

                            <u>My Thoughts: </u> Another favourite! This book is written in a fantasy setting. It is about 6 teenagers 
                            who are all part of a crime ring. They decide to pull off a heist in a kingdom; if they succeed, they will be 
                            unimaginably rich otherwise they could loose their lives. It is a thrilling tale about friendships and shared struggles.<br/>

                            <u>My Thoughts: </u> This is a book I read recently and I grew to like it, almost instantly. The main 
                            character is a girl named Sadie Wen. Sadie is one of the smartest girls in her class and she knows it.
                            Her focus has always been on maintaining her grades and securing her future, but it seems as though she forgot 
                            to have fun along the way. Throughout the course of the book she learns to loosen up and understands that maybe 
                            there is more to life, beyond grades.<br/>
